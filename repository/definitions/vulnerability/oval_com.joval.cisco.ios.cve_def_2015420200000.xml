    <oval-def:description>A vulnerability in the processing of IP Detail Record (IPDR) packets on Cisco uBR10000 devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gather a limited amount of IPDR data from the affected device.  The vulnerability is due to the inability of Cisco Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTS) to define access control lists (ACLs) specific to the IPDR service to block unauthorized users. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPDR packets requesting that a limited amount of information from an affected CMTS is exported back to the attacker's IP address. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gather a limited amount of IPDR data from the affected device.</oval-def:description>
