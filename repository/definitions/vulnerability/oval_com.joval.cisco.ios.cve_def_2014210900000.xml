    <oval-def:description>A vulnerability in the TCP Input module of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak or a reload of the affected device which could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to the way certain sequences of TCP packets are processed on an affected device when those packets undergo Network Address Translation (NAT). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific sequence of TCP packets to be processed by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak or reload of the affected device that would lead to a DoS condition.</oval-def:description>
