    <oval-def:description>Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on a targeted device.  The vulnerability is due to errors in processing malformed packets. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious network packets to a device. If successful, the attacker could cause components of the device to stop responding, resulting in a DoS condition.  Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security advisory and has released updated software.  Only devices that use Gambino DSP components are vulnerable. Devices with different DSP components, or those without the component, are unaffected.  To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send malicious network requests to affected devices. Attackers may require access to internal networks to send RTP requests to a device, limiting the potential for exploitation.  Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</oval-def:description>
