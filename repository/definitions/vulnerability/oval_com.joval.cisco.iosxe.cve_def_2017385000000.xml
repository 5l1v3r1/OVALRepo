    <oval-def:description>A vulnerability in the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI) feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation on certain crafted packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet to a device that is running a Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software release that supports the ANI feature.  A device must meet two conditions to be affected by this vulnerability:  The device must be running a version of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software that supports ANI (regardless of whether ANI is configured)  The device must have a reachable IPv6 interface  An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload.</oval-def:description>
