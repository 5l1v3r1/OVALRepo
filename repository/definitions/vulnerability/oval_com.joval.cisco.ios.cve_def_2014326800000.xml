    <oval-def:description>A vulnerability in handling Real-Time Control Protocol (RTCP) traffic in Cisco Unified Border Element (CUBE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause traffic that is destined to an affected device and traffic that needs to be processed switched to fail.  The vulnerability is due to exhaustion of the interface input queue by the RTCP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending RTCP packets in a specific sequence. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause traffic to fail that is destined to an affected device as well as traffic that needs to be processed switched.</oval-def:description>
