    <oval-def:description>Cisco IOSÂ® Software is affected by a denial of service vulnerability that may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause an affected device to reload or hang. The vulnerability may be triggered by a TCP segment containing crafted TCP options that is received during the TCP session establishment phase. In addition to specific, crafted TCP options, the device must have a special configuration to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
