    <oval-def:reference ref_id="CVE-2014-6271" source="CVE" />
    <oval-def:description>The bash shell allows shell variables and functions to be exported to a child from its parent through the process environment. Function definitions are passed using environment variables that share the name of the function and start with () {.  The child bash process does not stop processing and executing code after processing the closing brace } which is passed in the function definition. An attacker could define a function variable such as: FUNCT=() { ignored; }; /bin/id to execute /bin/id when the environment is imported into the child process.  The impact of this vulnerability on Cisco products may vary depending on the affected product because some attack vectors such as SSH, require successful authentication to be exploited and may not result in any additional privileges granted to the user.</oval-def:description>
