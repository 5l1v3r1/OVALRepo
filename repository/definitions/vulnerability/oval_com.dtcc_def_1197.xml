    <oval-def:description>Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Installer). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 8u152 and 9.0.1. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with logon to the infrastructure where Java SE executes to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE.</oval-def:description>
