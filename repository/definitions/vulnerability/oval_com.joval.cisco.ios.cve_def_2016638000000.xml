    <oval-def:description>A vulnerability in the DNS forwarder functionality of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload, corrupt the information present in the device's local DNS cache, or read part of the process memory.  The vulnerability is due to a flaw in handling crafted DNS response messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting and crafting a DNS response message to a client DNS query that was forwarded from the affected device to a DNS server. A successful exploit could cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition or corruption of the local DNS cache information.</oval-def:description>
