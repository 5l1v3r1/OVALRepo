    <oval-def:description>A vulnerability in the debugging features of Cisco IOS running on Cisco Aironet access points could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to create a denial of service condition.  The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly process a certain debugging message that may occur when the debug dot11 aaa authenticator all command is enabled and a crafted EAP packet is received. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a packet crafted to trigger the issue while a network administrator is actively debugging the device.  This vulnerability was reported to Cisco by Maxim Salomon and Timo Warns of Airbus Operations GmbH.</oval-def:description>
