    <oval-def:description>A vulnerability in the Overlay Transport Virtualization (OTV) processing code of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a reload of the affected device.  The vulnerability is due to improper processing of oversized OTV frames passing through an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of packets that are processed as oversized OTV frames that may require fragmentation and reassembly by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device.</oval-def:description>
