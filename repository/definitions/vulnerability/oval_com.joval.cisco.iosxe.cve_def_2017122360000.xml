    <oval-def:description>A vulnerability in the implementation of the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) in Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker using an x tunnel router to bypass authentication checks performed when registering an Endpoint Identifier (EID) to a Routing Locator (RLOC) in the map server/map resolver (MS/MR).  The vulnerability is due to a logic error introduced via a code regression for the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific valid map-registration requests, which will be accepted by the MS/MR even if the authentication keys do not match, to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject invalid mappings of EIDs to RLOCs in the MS/MR of the affected software.</oval-def:description>
