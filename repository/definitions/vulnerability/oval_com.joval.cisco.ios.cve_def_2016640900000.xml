    <oval-def:description>A vulnerability in the Cisco Data in Motion (DMo) component for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software with the IOx feature set could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a partial denial of service (DoS) condition for the DMo process on a targeted system.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checks by the affected component. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to a targeted system for processing by the affected component. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a partial DoS condition for the affected component on the targeted system.</oval-def:description>
