    <oval-def:description>OpenSSL contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause certain checks on untrusted certificates to be bypassed, enabling the attacker to forge "trusted" certificates that could be used to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks.  The vulnerability is due to an error in the implementation of the logic for finding an alternative certificate chain if the first attempt to build such a chain fails. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by submitting a crafted certificate chain to an affected device during SSL, TLS, or DTLS authentication. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause certain checks on untrusted certificates to be bypassed, enabling the attacker to forge "trusted" certificates that could be used to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks.</oval-def:description>
