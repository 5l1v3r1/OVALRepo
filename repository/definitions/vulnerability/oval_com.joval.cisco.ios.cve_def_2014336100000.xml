    <oval-def:description>A vulnerability in the application-layer gateway (ALG) module of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, which could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to how Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) messages that require network address translation (NAT) are processed on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SIP messages to be processed and translated by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, leading to a DoS condition.</oval-def:description>
