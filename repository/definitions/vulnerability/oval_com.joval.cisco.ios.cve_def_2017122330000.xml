    <oval-def:reference ref_id="CVE-2017-12233" source="CVE" />
    <oval-def:description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the implementation of the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) feature in Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerabilities are due to the improper parsing of crafted CIP packets destined to an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted CIP packets to be processed by an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.</oval-def:description>
