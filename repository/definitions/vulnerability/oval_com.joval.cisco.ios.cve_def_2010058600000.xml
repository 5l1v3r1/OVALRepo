    <oval-def:description>Devices running Cisco IOSÂ® Software and configured for Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express (CME) or Cisco Unified Survivable Remote Site Telephony (SRST) operation are affected by two denial of service vulnerabilities that may result in a device reload if successfully exploited. The vulnerabilities are triggered when the Cisco IOS device processes specific, malformed Skinny Call Control Protocol (SCCP) messages.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is posted at http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100324-cucme["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100324-cucme"].
