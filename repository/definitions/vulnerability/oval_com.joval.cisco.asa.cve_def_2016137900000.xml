    <oval-def:description>A vulnerability in the IPsec code of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the depletion of a memory block, which may cause the system to stop forwarding traffic and result in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to an error in the implementation of ICMP error handling for IPsec packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets through an established LAN-to-LAN or Remote Access VPN tunnel. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to deplete available memory and cause system instability or cause the system to stop forwarding traffic.</oval-def:description>
