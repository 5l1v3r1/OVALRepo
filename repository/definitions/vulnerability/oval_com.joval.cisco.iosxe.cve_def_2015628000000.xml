    <oval-def:description>A vulnerability in the SSH version 2 (SSHv2) implementation of the public key authentication method of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass user authentication.  The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the implementation of the SSHv2 public key authentication method, also known as Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA)-based user authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected system configured for SSHv2 RSA-based user authentication using a crafted private key. The attacker must know a valid username configured for RSA-based user authentication and the public key configured for that user to exploit this vulnerability.  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass user authentication and log in with the privileges of the user or with the privileges configured for the virtual teletype (VTY) line. Depending on the configuration of the user and of the VTY line, the attacker may obtain administrative privileges on the system. The attacker cannot use this vulnerability to elevate privileges.</oval-def:description>
