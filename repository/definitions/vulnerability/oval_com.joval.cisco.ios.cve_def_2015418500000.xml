    <oval-def:description>A vulnerability in the Tool Command Language (TCL) script interpreter of Cisco IOS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escalate privileges from those of a non-privileged user to a privileged (level 15) user. This would allow a non-privileged user to execute privileged commands (those under privilege level 15).  The vulnerability is due to an error when resetting vty privileges after running a TCL script. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a session with an affected device immediately after a TCL script has been run. An attacker would need to provide valid credentials and successfully pass authentication to the device.</oval-def:description>
