    <oval-def:description>A vulnerability in the DHCP subsystem of Cisco Aironet access points could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to create a denial of service condition.  The vulnerability is due to an error condition that may occur when very short DHCP leases are in use. If an attacker can prevent the access point from renewing its lease, the device may restart after unsuccessful DHCP Renew attempts in an effort to reestablish network connectivity. The expected behavior is that the network interface would restart but not the device.  This vulnerability was reported to Cisco by Maxim Salomon and Timo Warns of Airbus Operations GmbH.</oval-def:description>
